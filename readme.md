SUPPORT

I'm making every effort to build a program that will work without issue. However, there are many moving parts and some services that I do NOT control. If you run into any issues you can catch one of my streams and let me know and I'll make my best effort to address them.

You can also report issues using Github in the project's section: https://github.com/MorenoDev/WakisMakis/issues.
